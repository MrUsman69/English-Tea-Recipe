    <h1>HOW TO MAKE ENGLISH TEA</h1>

    <h2>The Recipe Ingdredients :</h2>
    <p>When learning how to make English tea, you just need 3 ingredients (plus water). </p>
    <ul>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h3>Black tea</h3>
            </li> there are plenty of types of black tea to choose from. However, here in the UK, there are a few
            standout
            popular options of robust black teas, including English breakfast tea and Earl Grey. Use tea bags or loose
            tea
            (either loose or in sachets). The latter tends to be of higher quality.

                <h3>Milk</h3>
                use your desired fat level of milk (whole, semi-skimmed, skimmed). You can also use certain
                dairy-free milks, but be careful as some will separate in hot liquids.

                <h3>Water</h3>
            </li>
            to make the base of English tea.

                <h3>Sweetener (optional)</h3>
            </li>
            typically, granulated white sugar is used. However, you can use brown sugar, honey, or even a sugar-free
            sweetener like stevia or erythritol.

                <h2>The Method :</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h3> Step#1 : Heat The Water </h3>
                    </li>

                    Unlike what many believe, it’s actually not best to boil the water when making tea. In fact, most
                    types of tea come with an ideal temperature on their packaging based on the type of tea inside.
                    Black tea is one of the only types that can handle the highest temperatures of around 203ºF/95ºC, up
                    to boiling point 212ºF/100ºC.

                    <li>
                        <h3>Step#2 : Steep The Tea</h3>
                    </li>

                    Pour the hot water over the tea (don’t fill it to the top and you need space for the milk) and then
                    leave it too steep for between 3-5 minutes based on how strong you want the tea to be.

                    <li>
                        <h3>Step#3 : The Finishing Touches</h3>
                    </li>

                    Next, add the sugar/sweetener (optional) to the cup/s and stir well until it’s dissolved.

                    Finally, add the milk, starting with just a splash and increasing to taste.

                    The amount of milk to add is once again down to personal taste. Start with a small splash (about 1
                    teaspoon) and increase to taste. Soon you’ll know by color when you’ve reached your personal milk
                    tea “sweet spot” – no one ever measures.
